			<h1>About</h1>
			<p>
				Our application is built upon a robust machine learning model that has been trained on a comprehensive dataset of breast cancer cases. By inputting key patient information, such as clinical features and medical history, our model swiftly analyzes the data and provides a reliable prediction of the likelihood of breast cancer presence. Our model's accuracy and performance are continuously optimized through ongoing research and development.
